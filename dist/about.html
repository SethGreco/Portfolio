        Hello, I am a full-stack webdevleoper in the making. I am a recently
        graduated from UTSA (University of Texas at San Antonio) in 2019 with a
        degree in Computer Science. My studies focused mainly on software
        engineering and using languages such as Python and C. Through different
        ideas & solo projects I found web-development to be very enjoyable and a
        good challenge for me to undertake. Starting with Django and developing
        back-end apis I branched into learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Mysql,
        Mongo and other web related technologies to make a robust skillset.
