# Portfolio

My Professional Portfolio Web Developer Website. Includes elements of HTML, CSS (w/ Sass) and Node. Under Construction

HTML5 & CSS3

Website will use modern HTML as foundation mock up. CSS w/sass we do most of the initial styling.

The Goal will be to have this as a Full-stack presentation relying on a MERN Stack and including API calls to seperate Projects.

INITIAL SETUP
used npm to create a package-json file.
File was edited to run sass for auto generating main.css into my /dist folder upon every save.
dist/ contains the actual project files.

/Sass includes my sass files that are my direct interaction with styling the web pages.

Modules & Libraries included:
sass
create-react-app
nodemon
concurrently
body-parser
mongoose
express

Package.json SETUP

package file was set up with concurrently to run multiple scripts at at once for server maintaince.
nodemon to detect any changes made to files and restart server automacially and sass for editing the main.css file.

DataBase/MONGO

Using a remote Mongo Hosted DB through Atlas: MongDB atlas.

Installed mongoose as an ORM for mongo.

GOOGLE MAPS API
Using Google Maps for JS.
Qouta set to API usage.
