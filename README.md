# Portfolio
My Professional Portfolio Web Developer Website.  Includes elements of HTML, CSS (w/ Sass) and Node.  Under Construction


HTML5  &  CSS3

Website will use modern HTML as foundation mock up.  CSS w/sass we do most of the initial styling.

The Goal will be to have this as a Full-stack presentation relying on a MERN Stack and including API calls to seperate Projects.


INITIAL SETUP
used npm to create a package-json file.
File was edited to run sass for auto generating main.css into my /dist folder upon every save.
dist/ contains the actual project files.

/Sass includes my sass files that are my direct interaction with styling the web pages.
