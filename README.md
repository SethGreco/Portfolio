# Portfolio

My Professional Portfolio Web Developer Website. Includes elements of HTML, CSS (w/ Sass) and Node. Under Construction

# HTML5 & CSS3

Website will use modern HTML for mark up. CSS w/sass will cover all styling for landing page.

The Goal will be to have this as a Full-stack presentation relying on a MERN Stack and including API calls to various web services and related projects.
